# Changes in Dockware

All notable changes of Dockware releases are documented in this file 
using the [Keep a CHANGELOG](https://keepachangelog.com/) principles.

## [1.5.4]
- Add the storefront watcher, admin watcher, and build admin commands to the essentials image

## [1.5.3]

### Added
- Add new ENV variable NODE_VERSION and "nvm" to switch between Node v12, v14 and v16

### Fixed
- Fixed broken XDebug after switching PHP versions.
- 

## [1.5.2]

### Fixed
- Fix problem where it was not possible to provide a custom WORKDIR. The images will now switch back to this directory in the entrypoint before running custom commands.


## [1.5.1]

### BREAKING CHANGES FOR CI/CD PIPELINES
With 1.5.1 with changed the entrypoint to use the real ENTRYPOINT command instead of the CMD command in the Dockerfile.
The previous version allowed you to provide a custom command (e.g. in your pipelines) to be executed within dockware.
This worked, but did not use the original entrypoint, which means that neither the PHP_VERSION switch, launch of MySQL or other things worked.
The new change does always load the original entrypoint along all its configured features of dockware.

This however would lead to a blocking long-running container with Shopware. 
If you still want to just execute your single command in dockware within your pipeline, 
please provide the env variable DOCKWARE_CI=1 and the container will automatically quit as soon as your command has been executed


### Added
- Add new ENV variable DOCKWARE_CI to automatically stop the container, once your custom command in your pipeline has been executed with dockware.
- Add Node v16 to Shopware >= 6.4 and Shopware >= 5.7. All previous versions still have Node v12.

### Improved:
- Shopware is now installed as www-data in a clean way. So all permissions of all files should be as clean as possible now when launching containers.

### Fixed
- Fixed broken XDebug scripts from previous releases
- Fixed "Plugin Build" mode that did not find the bin/build-js.sh file correctly.
- Fixed wrong warning outputs of Apache when starting the containers. This did not have any impact. It was just a weird warning output.
- Fixed problem with broken permissions after using the storefront watcher with our makefile
