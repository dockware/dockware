## What is dockware/dev?
dockware is a managed Shopware 6 docker image.

Run and explore any Shopware 6 version within minutes locally in docker.
No more hassle and blazing fast!

With dockware it's easy to explore Shopware and start developing in a smooth and seamless environment!

## How to use this image

### Quick Start
If you want to start the image and give it a try, simply
use the following command.

For the latest Shopware version use the tag `latest`, or use any other existing Shopware 6 version like `6.1.3`.

You can also switch to another PHP version by providing the ENV variable.

```ruby
# quick run with latest PHP and Shopware
$ docker run --rm -p 80:80 dockware/dev:6.6.7.0

# use another php version
$ docker run --rm -p 80:80 --env PHP_VERSION=7.2 dockware/dev:6.6.7.0
```

Please be aware that any modifications you make while Shopware is running, will be lost
when stopping and restarting the container.
This is really for easy plug and play tests.

If you want to keep your data, please read the information about persisting containers in this README.

### Environment Variables

### Container Access
You can access the container either by using the docker exec command, or by using a ssh command.
If you want to access your container using SSH please make sure to expose port `22` (see docker-compose template below).

```ruby
# docker command
$ docker exec -it shopware bash

# ssh command with custom port
$ ssh dockware@localhost -p 22
```

Please use the following credentials for SSH or SFTP:

```ruby
user: dockware
password: dockware
Remote Path: /var/www/html
```

## Persistent data
The easy first run is perfect to immediately start Shopware, but does not persist any data or allows you to reuse that Shopware 6 instance again after restarting your host.
If you want to persist any data or changes you made, please create a volume and map these 2 folders to persist
the database and the DocRoot of Shopware.

* /var/lib/mysql
* /var/www/html

## Docker Compose Template
This is a full template with everything that can be done using dockware.
Please note that not all of these settings might be necessary.

```ruby
dockware:
    image: dockware/dev:6.6.7.0
    container_name: shopware
    ports:
        - "80:80"
        - "22:22"
        # Admin Watcher Port
        - "8888:8888"
        # Storefront Watcher Port
        - "9999:9999"
    environment:
        - PHP_VERSION=8.3
        - XDEBUG_ENABLED=1
        - SW_CURRENCY=GBP  
```

## Configuration Options

### Custom SSH User
It's possible to create a separate SSH access that replaces the one that comes out of the box with dockware.
For this, please provide the corresponding environment variables.
This will lead to an automatically created new SSH user when the docker container is launched.

```ruby
dockware:
  image: dockware/dev:6.6.7.0
  environment:
    - SSH_USER=userABC
    - SSH_PWD=supersecret
```

### Tideways Integration
Dockware comes with an installed Tideways agent.
You can enable this optional integration by simply providing your API key as environment variable.
In additional to this, you can add additional settings like the Tideways Environment identifiers.
Please keep in mind, that these settings might not be working for all Tideways packages (see Tideways for more).

```ruby
dockware:
  image: dockware/dev:6.6.7.0
  environment:
    - TIDEWAYS_KEY=xxx
    - TIDEWAYS_ENV=dev
```

### Filebeat Integration
The Filebeat integration allows you to automatically send log data and files to your Logstash instance if you use an ELK stack.

Please keep in mind, if Filebeat is enabled, you need a configured `filebeat.yml` file that is injected using bind-mounting.
In addition to this, your Docker container must have access to your logstash container by either using the links or networks in Docker.
This needs to be done only if you also have your Logstash within your Docker network :)

```ruby
dockware:
  image: dockware/dev:6.6.7.0
  volumes:
    - ./elk/myservice/filebeat.yml:/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml
  environment:
    - FILEBEAT_ENABLED=1
```
